Life feels quite overwhelming lately - between lectures, interviews, and everything in between, I rarely find a moment to just sit down and breathe. Most days feel like a blur of deadlines and small victories, one thing rolling into the next before I even realize it.  

Yet there’s something about that pace that I enjoy. The intensity keeps me sharp - pushing yourself to the limit is the best way to grow, and there’s a certain satisfaction in knowing you’re giving it your all. I wouldn’t want it any other way.  

Still, as much as the grind pushes you forward, it’s easy to lose sight of *why* you’re doing it. It’s important to take a step back and reflect - to think about where you’re actually heading, instead of constantly chasing the next big thing. Without that pause, it all starts to feel like a rat race. This blog helps me slow down, gain perspective, and make sure I’m moving with direction rather than just motion.  

It also gives me a bit of retrospective. A friend of mine, Endri, once told me that life is like buttoning up a dress shirt: you only know if you did it right at the very end. I think about that often. It’s a reminder that so much of what we do day to day doesn’t always make sense in the moment. The long nights, the stress, the constant push forward, they can feel scattered and directionless. But maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. You keep moving, making the best decisions you can, trusting that when you look back, it’ll all line up the way it was meant to.
