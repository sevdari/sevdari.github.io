It’s been a while since I’ve paused and genuinely felt good about my life. Not just okay. Not just coping. Actually good.

And being back in this headspace feels kind of surreal - in the best way.

Right now, there’s just a lot to be grateful for. I’ve met people at ETH that I genuinely enjoy being around. I have space again for the things that make me feel like myself: running, training, random hobbies that used to get squeezed out. I’m working hard again, properly hard, and it feels clean instead of forced. There’s a bit of romantic excitement in the mix. I move my body regularly. I feel alive.

And I have energy. Real, steady energy. I started paying attention to the basics - eating properly, taking recovery seriously, making sure I get enough protein, taking magnesium before bed, the small things I used to brush off. I didn’t think they would matter much. They do. Better sleep, better recovery, clearer days.

I also feel optimistic about where things are heading in my career. The people around me inspire me and raise my standards. And the opportunities on the horizon feel earned, not accidental - like a natural consequence of consistent effort rather than luck.

Nothing dramatic has happened. No big breakthrough. Just a lot of small adjustments that slowly compounded. For the first time in a while, I wake up and don’t dread the day.

That feels like something worth writing down.
